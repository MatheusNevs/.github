## Hey! I'm Matheus Fernandes 👋

**Computer Engineering Student @ UnB** | 6G Researcher | Telecommunications Enthusiast

Focused on **next-generation wireless communications (6G)** and **physical/data link layer engineering**. My work involves spectrum coexistence analysis, digital modulation schemes, and simulations for scenarios between Mobile Communication Systems.

### 🔬 Research & Technical Focus

- **6G & Mobile Communications**: Spectrum sharing, interference analysis between IMT systems and Non-Terrestrial Networks using SHARC simulator
- **Physical & Data Link Layers**: Digital and carrier modulations (ASK, FSK, PSK, QAM), error detection/correction, radio propagation modeling
- **Expanding Horizons**: Interested in developing solutions across upper network layers as well
- **Software Development**: Experience in systems programming (C++, Python) and web development (React, Next.js, TypeScript)

### 💻 Tech Stack

**Telecom & Physical Layer**: 4G/5G/6G Systems • Digital Modulations (QAM, PSK, FSK, ASK) • Error Detection/Correction • Radio Propagation • Spectrum Analysis  
**Programming**: C++ • Python • TypeScript  
**Infrastructure**: Docker • Cloud Computing • Network Virtualization

### 🎯 Career Goals
